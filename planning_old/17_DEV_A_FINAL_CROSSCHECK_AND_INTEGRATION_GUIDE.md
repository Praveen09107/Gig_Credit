# Dev A Final Cross-Check and Dev B Integration Playbook (Production-Grade)

Last Updated: 2026-03-19  
Repository: GigCredit-AI4Good (`main`)  
Audience: Dev A, Dev B, QA, release owner  
Goal: Provide a complete implementation status, conflict-free integration procedure, and post-pull production closure plan.

---

## 1) Final Decision Summary

### 1.1 Dev A completion verdict

- **Dev A implementation for integration scope:** **COMPLETE and ready to hand off now**.
- **Dev A implementation for final production signoff:** **NOT fully closed yet** due to runtime/deployment prerequisites that are external to pure source-code implementation.

### 1.2 Dev B integration readiness verdict

- **Dev B can integrate immediately** using current interfaces, artifacts, and startup gate behavior.
- Dev B should integrate against this branch state before final production gate runs.

### 1.3 Why this is not yet full production signoff

The following are still required before “real-world production prototype” signoff:

1. Real model files in `gigcredit_app/assets/models/`.
2. Verified Android dependency/package closure (ML Kit/TFLite in full Android module context).
3. Physical-device E2E + deployed backend + final report generation signoff in release-like environment.

---

## 2) Scope of this cross-check

This final cross-check covered:

1. Planning/spec corpus re-scan.
2. Requirement-to-implementation traceability refresh.
3. Endpoint parity refresh.
4. Model/artifact presence refresh.
5. Backend, Offline ML, Flutter analyze, and Flutter test validation reruns.
6. Generated scorer syntax normalization and artifact manifest checksum re-validation.

---

## 3) Validation evidence (latest run)

### 3.1 Test and analysis status

1. Backend smoke suite:
   - Command: `python -m unittest backend.tests.test_contract_smoke -v`
   - Status: **PASS (7/7)**
2. Offline ML artifact smoke suite:
   - Command: `python -m unittest offline_ml.tests.test_artifact_handoff_smoke -v`
   - Status: **PASS (2/2)**
3. Flutter static analysis:
   - Command: `flutter analyze`
   - Status: **PASS (no issues)**
4. Flutter test suite:
   - Command: `flutter test test`
   - Status: **PASS (all tests passed)**

### 3.2 Important note on Windows execution

- In this workspace, Flutter operations require short-path execution due to path-with-spaces tooling issues.
- Reliable pattern:
  - `subst X: "d:\Program Files\GigCredit"`
  - run Flutter commands from `X:\gigcredit_app`.

---

## 5) Dev B full integration guide (exact, conflict-safe)

## 5.1 What Dev B must implement after pulling this work

These are Dev B execution items using Dev A delivered assets/contracts:

1. Wire all step flows to consume real Dev A runtime outputs, not fallback stubs.
2. Replace any remaining mock/stub scorer path with generated scorer pack in app.
3. Consume Dev A metadata and confidence outputs in scoring/report orchestration.
4. Integrate strict production gate behavior into full app flow (not only workbench context).
5. Re-run complete UX-level validations for step progression and recovery states.

---

## 5.2 Pre-integration pull checklist (Dev B)

1. Pull latest `main`.
2. Ensure generated scorer files and constants exist in expected locations.
3. Verify startup gate files compile in current branch.
4. Run baseline commands:
   - `python -m unittest backend.tests.test_contract_smoke -v`
   - `python -m unittest offline_ml.tests.test_artifact_handoff_smoke -v`
   - `flutter analyze`
   - `flutter test test`

---

## 5.3 Integration sequence (recommended order)

### Step A: Runtime contract alignment

- Integrate against:
  - `gigcredit_app/lib/ai/NATIVE_BRIDGE_CONTRACT.md`
  - `gigcredit_app/lib/ai/ai_native_bridge.dart`
  - `gigcredit_app/lib/ai/native_document_processor.dart`

### Step B: Startup policy behavior alignment

- Development/integration mode:
  - `GIGCREDIT_REQUIRE_PRODUCTION_READINESS=false`
- Release/UAT/prod-like mode:
  - `GIGCREDIT_REQUIRE_PRODUCTION_READINESS=true`

### Step C: Backend route usage alignment

- Prefer `/verify/*` endpoints for new client calls.
- Keep compatibility with `/gov/*` where legacy wiring remains during transition.

### Step D: Scoring artifact consumption alignment

- Consume only packaged/generated artifacts.
- Do not hand-edit generated scorer source files.

### Step E: UX flow reconciliation

- Ensure all step-level state transitions reflect real runtime output.
- Ensure failure/retry paths consume startup/runtimes checks consistently.

---

## 5.4 No-conflict integration rules

1. Do not manually modify generated files:
   - `gigcredit_app/lib/scoring/generated/*`
   - `gigcredit_app/assets/constants/artifact_manifest.json`
2. If schema/contract change is required:
   - Update contract docs first.
   - Update provider/runtime and consumer in same PR.
3. Keep ownership boundaries:
   - Dev A: runtime contracts, artifact generation, backend auth/verify/report core.
   - Dev B: UX/state orchestration, step integration, report UI flow.

---

## 5.5 Post-integration smoke checks (Dev B)

1. Startup gate behavior:
   - Production-required OFF -> app should proceed.
   - Production-required ON + missing prerequisites -> app must block with clear reasons.
2. Runtime health display and refresh behavior.
3. End-to-end flow continuity from KYC to report generation path.
4. Scoring outputs and explanation rendering consistency.

---

## 6) Remaining work after Dev A push and Dev B pull (production closure)

## 6.1 Remaining Dev A / release-engineering tasks

1. Provide real model binaries:
   - `gigcredit_app/assets/models/efficientnet_lite0.tflite`
   - `gigcredit_app/assets/models/mobilefacenet.tflite`
2. Complete Android dependency/package closure in full Android project context.
3. Finalize deployment URL and release backend configuration handoff.
4. Support final UAT and resolve runtime-specific defects.

## 6.2 Remaining Dev B tasks

1. Full step-flow integration against real runtime/scoring paths.
2. Remove residual mock-only branches from production path.
3. Validate confidence + SHAP consumption with final artifact definitions.
4. Perform full app regression and capture evidence for signoff.

## 6.3 Remaining QA / joint tasks

1. Physical-device E2E signoff (real environment).
2. Validate report output schemas and language behavior in deployed backend context.
3. Final production checklist signoff across Dev A + Dev B + QA.

---

## 7) Explicit completion answer for leadership/status reporting

### 7.1 “Has Dev A completed all assigned work?”

- **For integration handoff:** **YES**.
- **For final production signoff:** **NOT YET (pending environment/runtime closure items).**

### 7.2 “Is this ready for Dev B integration now?”

- **YES. Ready now.**

### 7.3 “What blocks final production-grade real-world prototype?”

1. Missing real model binaries in assets.
2. Android dependency/package closure in real build context.
3. Physical-device E2E + deployed-environment signoff.

---

## 8) Quick runbook commands

### 8.1 Backend + ML smoke

- `python -m unittest backend.tests.test_contract_smoke -v`
- `python -m unittest offline_ml.tests.test_artifact_handoff_smoke -v`

### 8.2 Flutter checks

- `flutter analyze`
- `flutter test test`

### 8.3 Windows path workaround (if needed)

1. `subst X: "d:\Program Files\GigCredit"`
2. `cd X:\gigcredit_app`
3. Run Flutter commands from this path.
