# Dev A Required Implementation (From Full Workflow + Dev B Plan)

Last Updated: 2026-03-19
Scope: Exact Dev A deliverables needed to close full system

## Current Branch Status (Implementation Delta)

### Completed in this branch

- 3-layer validation orchestration implemented in `gigcredit_app/lib/ai/verification_validation_engine.dart`.
- Transaction parsing + EMI/utility/insurance extraction implemented in `gigcredit_app/lib/ai/transaction_engine.dart`.
- Secure cleanup policy implemented in `gigcredit_app/lib/ai/secure_cleanup_policy.dart`.
- Android native runtime upgraded with capability-aware OCR/authenticity/face paths + `ai.health` capability flags.
- Dart-side capability gating implemented (`ai_native_bridge.dart` + `native_document_processor.dart`) with deterministic fallback routing.
- UI runtime status + refresh implemented in scoring workbench (`native_runtime_provider.dart`, `scoring_workbench_screen.dart`).
- Backend compatibility aliases added for `/verify/*` endpoint family in addition to existing `/gov/*` routes.
- Startup self-check gate implemented: when `GIGCREDIT_REQUIRE_PRODUCTION_READINESS=true`, app startup is blocked if backend config or native model capabilities are missing.

### Enforced production prerequisites (startup will block when required mode is enabled)

- Real production model files must exist under `gigcredit_app/assets/models/`.
- Native runtime dependency capabilities (OCR + TFLite/model paths) must be available at runtime.
- Backend base URL must be configured via `GIGCREDIT_BACKEND_BASE_URL`.

### Delivery interpretation

- Dev A code paths are production-oriented, fallback-safe, and now strict-mode enforceable.
- Final production sign-off still requires physical-device E2E and deployment-environment verification outside this code-only workspace.

## Source Plans

- planning/5_DEV_A_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
- planning/14_DEV_A_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
- planning/6_DEV_B_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
- planning/3_END_TO_END_WORKFLOW_FREEZE.md
- planning/1_SCORING_ENGINE_SPEC_FREEZE.md

## P0 - Mandatory Deliverables to Unblock Completion

### 1) Backend APIs (Production-Ready)

Implement and deploy fully functional endpoints:

- POST /verify/pan
- POST /verify/aadhaar
- POST /verify/bank/ifsc
- POST /verify/bank/account
- POST /verify/vehicle/rc
- POST /verify/insurance
- POST /verify/income-tax/itr
- POST /verify/eshram
- POST /verify/loan
- POST /report/generate

Must include:

- Real request validation
- Real response schema consistency
- Error handling and fallback behavior
- Authentication and rate limiting (API key + HMAC path from hardening spec)

### 2) Offline ML Artifact Handoff

Deliver these artifacts in app-consumable format:

- p1_scorer.dart
- p2_scorer.dart
- p3_scorer.dart
- p4_scorer.dart
- p5_scorer.dart
- p6_scorer.dart
- assets/constants/meta_coefficients.json
- assets/constants/shap_lookup.json (final version)

Must satisfy frozen scoring rules:

- Final score path is LR meta-learner
- Score mapping is round(300 + sigmoid(logit) * 600)
- No weighted-sum fallback as final scoring mode

### 3) AI Runtime Implementations

Implement concrete classes for:

- OcrEngine
- AuthenticityDetector
- FaceVerifier
- DocumentProcessor (orchestration)

Then wire via DI so Dev B step screens can call real implementations.

## P1 - Integration Tasks in App Layer

(Dev A-owned as per integration guide)

1. Set deployed backend base URL in backend_client.dart.
2. Place scorer Dart files in expected scoring location.
3. Place meta_coefficients.json in assets/constants.
4. Ensure pubspec asset entries include constants files.
5. Load real coefficients in dev_a_handoff_adapter.dart path.
6. Load final SHAP bins in shap_lookup_service.dart path.
7. Add/create DI wiring file for AI implementations.
8. Replace step-level stubs with real AI/provider calls.

## P2 - Validation and Acceptance

Before declaring Dev A complete:

1. Run flutter analyze with zero errors.
2. Run flutter test and keep current suite green.
3. Execute physical-device end-to-end flow:

- Login/OTP
- KYC
- Bank parsing
- EMI stage
- Scoring
- Explainability
- Final PDF report

1. Validate score reproducibility against provided artifacts.
2. Validate report/generate backend output schema and language behavior.

## Step-wise Dev A Mapping to Workflow

- Entry and auth: backend auth headers + secure API checks
- Step 2: PAN/Aadhaar verification services
- Step 3: bank verify endpoints + bank compatibility support
- Steps 4 to 8: verification endpoints + OCR authenticity interfaces
- Step 9: loan verification endpoint behavior
- Final report: report/generate explanation service
- Scoring core: p1..p6 scorers + meta coefficients + SHAP asset

## Final Closure Condition

Dev A is considered fully complete only when:

1. All backend verify/report endpoints are implemented and live.
2. All ML scorer and coefficient artifacts are delivered and integrated.
3. AI interface implementations are wired and used in runtime.
4. End-to-end mobile run produces final score and PDF report without mock/stub fallbacks.
