## How to use
- Mark each item as PASS, FAIL, or BLOCKED.
- Attach evidence links for every PASS item.
- Do not mark overall signoff as PASS unless all Critical items are PASS.

## Status legend
- PASS: Requirement delivered and verified.
- FAIL: Requirement missing or incorrect.
- BLOCKED: Awaiting external dependency (for example, environment or access).

| F6 | report generation E2E evidence (with deployed backend) | QA | BLOCKED | not available in current workspace | Requires deployed backend + QA evidence |

## G. Release Signoff Gates

| Gate | Condition | Status | Signoff By | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 Integration Ready | All A and B items PASS | PENDING |  |  |
| G2 Pre-Production Ready | A, B, C, D items PASS | PENDING |  |  |
| G3 Production Candidate Ready | A through F items PASS | PENDING |  |  |
| G4 Final Release Signoff | All gates PASS with evidence attached | PENDING |  |  |

## H. Open Risks and Blockers
- Runtime model binaries (`.tflite`) not delivered yet for strict runtime-ready mode. Owner: Dev A. ETA: TBD.
- Runtime model binaries still missing (`efficientnet_lite0.tflite`, `mobilefacenet.tflite`). Owner: ML/runtime artifact owner. ETA: TBD.
- Flutter checks pass in no-space mirror path (`D:\GigCreditProdReady\gigcredit_app`); keep same setup for repeatable CI/local runs.
- Deployed backend URL and deployed-environment auth/rate-limit validation not finalized. Owner: Release + QA. ETA: TBD.

## I. Final Outcome
- Current outcome: NOT SIGNED OFF
- Required to close: Complete all pending Critical items and all release gates.
